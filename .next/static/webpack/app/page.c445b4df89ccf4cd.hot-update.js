Dubai makes a great base from which to explore the many attractions that UAE has and its shopping, nightlife and hotels are second to none.\\n\\nOff the beaten track you’ll discover hidden treasures such as ancient mosques, historical forts, national parks and much much more. UAE is very much a country of ancient and modern contrasts, with its largely unchanged rural farming villages sitting next to ultra-modern 6-star hotels, and bone dry deserts to plush beach locations.\\n\\nThere are 15 Erbil locations across UAE. 10 of these are spread across Dubai and Northern Emirates and 5 locations are in the Abu Dhabi Region.

However, the local driving standards often don’t match the quality of the roads and with a population consisting of around 80% ex-pats, there is a variety of opinions on how to drive, particularly in the main urban areas such as Dubai.","driving-in.uae4":"What are the speed limits in Dubai?","driving-in.uae5":"The speed limit on the main motorways and highways will be either 100kph or 120kph. Within cities the main roads usually have a limit of 80kph but you’ll need to keep an eye on the road signs because this can vary. Within built-up areas the limit is usually 40kph.\\n\\n","driving-in.uae6":"Important information for driving in Dubai:\\n\\n","driving-in.uae7":"If you see a stationary school bus then you should stop until it moves off again.","driving-in.uae8":"Because UAE is expanding so rapidly, its rules and regulations are changing all the time and this applies to its laws on driving as well so before you set off it’s well worth checking out the local rules.","driving-in.uae9":"In order to rent a car you’ll need a valid photo licence and you may also need an International Driving Permit depending on your country of origin. You will need to keep all of your papers (passport, licence and rental agreement) with you at all times.","driving-in.uae10":"Drivers in UAE drive on the right and children under 13 are not allowed to sit in the passenger seat. Children between 4 and 8 must use a booster seat. All passengers should wear their seat belts and if you want to use your phone while at the wheel, you’ll need a hands free kit.","driving-in.uae11":"Trams are common in UAE and they take precedence over cars and other road vehicles so be aware of them and make sure you give way to them.","driving-in.uae12":"Top Cities In UAE: 1.Dubai 2.Sharjah 3.Abu dhabi 4.Al Ain 5.Fujairah 6.Ras al Khaimah","driving-in.uae13":"Special attractions","driving-in.uae14":"There are many very wealthy people in UAE and it is absolutely packed full of supercars. Walk down any street in central Dubai or Abu Dhabi and you’ll spot Bentleys, Bugattis and Ferraris so it’s a great holiday destination for car enthusiasts.\\n\\nFerarri World in Abu Dhabi is the only Ferrari-themed park and the biggest indoor park in the world. It also features the world’s fastest roller coaster, Formula Rossa.\\n\\nIn 2015 Ferrari World was voted the leading tourist attraction in the Middle East at the World Travel Awards.","driving-in.uae15":"Quick Information","driving-in.uae16":"Minimum car rental age: For most car types you need to be 21 or over. Certain makes and models require you to be 25 or over.\\nAverage speed limits: The speed limit on highways and motorways is either 100kph or 120kph. Main roads in cities have a limit of 80kph and in built-up areas it is 40kph.\\n","driving-in.uae17":"Driving in UAE\\n\\nDrive on the right and pass on the left but don’t assume that everyone else will stick to this rule.\\n\\nIf you don’t wish to drive in UAE, or are unable to, Erbil also offers a Chauffeur-Drive service.\\n\\nLicence requirements\\n\\nDriving licences from certain countries are valid in UAE, these are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United States of America.\\n\\nDrivers from all other countries will need an International Driving Permit.\\n\\nLicences must have been held for at least one year.\\n\\nTolls and fees\\n\\nThere are several crossing points in UAE that incur a charge and these will automatically be added to your bill at the end of your hire period.\\n\\nDriving with children\\n\\nSeats for very small children aren’t compulsory in UAE but it is highly recommended that you use one anyway and they are available to hire from Erbil car rental branches. Children between 4 and 8 need to be on a booster seat and those under 13 are not allowed to sit in the front of the vehicle.","driving-in.dubai1":"There are 12 locations for Erbil car rental in Dubai, making it quick and easy to get around when you visit the emirate. With some of the most stunning buildings in the world such as the Burj Khalifa (the world’s tallest structure) and the Burj al-Arab hotel (the world’s only 7-star hotel), driving is a great way to get around the city state and see all it has to offer — as well as keeping you safely out of the incredibly hot sun.\\n\\n","driving-in.dubai2":"Dubai’s popularity as a luxury holiday destination has boomed in recent years. As well as enjoying the beach and, perhaps, relaxing in luxury hotels there’s a lot to see in Dubai. Old Dubai has many historic buildings and mosques as well as wonderful souks, whereas in Modern Dubai you can shop to your heart’s content. Driving, of course, lets you do both.\\n\\n","driving-in.dubai3":"Driving and Parking in Dubai\\n","driving-in.dubai4":"What do I need to drive in Dubai?\\n\\nYou will need a full driving licence and must be over 21 to rent a car in Dubai. If you are from outside the United Arab Emirates you will also need an International Driving Permit (IDP). For more information about driving regulations in Dubai, take a look at our page about renting a car in the UAE.","driving-in.dubai5":"What is the best way to get around Dubai?\\n\\nWhile by car is the best and easiest way to see Dubai, there’s no getting around the fact that Dubai is hard to navigate. So it is worth bringing a Sat Nav with you or ensuring you have data connectivity on your phone and using a maps app to navigate. You will need to take care on the roads and ensure that you follow the rules and regulations to the letter when driving.","driving-in.dubai6":"What is parking like in Dubai?\\n\\nParking in Dubai is generally a mix of pay-to-park car parks and city parking zones. Parking zones use pay and display machines although the local government has recently introduced the mParking service where you can pay for parking by sending a text message from your mobile phone when you rent a car in Dubai.","driving-in.dubai7":"Driving in and around Dubai\\n","driving-in.dubai8":"Key Routes\\n","driving-in.dubai9":"The E11 motorway is one of the main routes through Dubai. It’s pretty spectacular in itself with six lanes running in each direction, but that’s nothing to the views of towering skyscrapers it offers as it cuts through central Dubai. For those wanting a more relaxed pace of driving, Jumeirah Road (D94) will take you along the front near to the public beaches, leading to Al Sufouh Road which takes you towards Dubai Marina where you can catch a glimpse of the exclusive Palm Jumeirah.\\n\\n","driving-in.dubai10":"It’s worth noting that several of the major routes within Dubai are toll roads. Erbil branches will supply a Salik tag (fitted in your car) which will register every time you travel on a toll road. This is charged at a rate of AED5.00 each time your vehicle passes through the cross points. When you return your hire car, this will be added up and you will be charged accordingly.\\n\\n","driving-in.dubai11":"Major Highways\\n","driving-in.dubai12":"The UAE as a whole has a fantastic motorway system connecting the different Emirates. If you wish to explore beyond Dubai, The E11 will carry you to Abu Dhabi or, in the opposite direction, to Sharjah. The E66, on the other hand, will take you through to Al Ain. The motorway system connects in turn with a well-developed road network of smaller motorways, dual carriageways and urban and desert roads.\\n\\n","driving-in.dubai13":"Dubai police are strict when it comes to enforcing speed limits so make sure you are aware of local limitations as you travel.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi1":"Erbil makes car rental in Abu Dhabi easy with branches conveniently located in and around the city. There is so much to see and do in Abu Dhabi that renting a car is essential if you want to get round everything without relying on taxis or buses. The temperatures in the emirate are scorching so a car can also give you some much-needed air conditioning and shade.","driving-in.abu-dhabi2":"Abu Dhabi has boomed as a tourist destination in recent years and is continuing to do so, with the developments on Yas Island – the existing F1 circuit and a Ferrari theme park to come — making it an amazing destination for car lovers. This is accentuated by Abu Dhabi’s excellent roads and traffic light system that make it stand out against other emirates.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi3":"Driving and Parking in Abu Dhabi\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi4":"You will need a full driving licence and must be over 21 to rent a car in Abu Dhabi. If you are from outside the United Arab Emirates you will also need an International Driving Permit (IDP). For more information about driving regulations in Abu Dhabi, take a look at our page about renting a car in the UAE .\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi5":"Despite the excellent roads, driving in Abu Dhabi needs a good level of focus and attention. Ensure that you follow the local speed limit and never drink-drive, which can result in a prison sentence. Cameras at intersections monitor drivers who run red lights and there is a fine of up to AED500.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi6":"If you rent a car in Abu Dhabi, you will find there are several pay-to-park car parks as well as parking within hotels and resorts. If you choose on-street parking, you will use the Mawaqif system, which is in force from 08.00 until midnight Saturday to Thursday, excluding public holidays. Parking meters set limits for use of the spaces and you will pay between AED2 and AED3 per hour or AED15 per day, making it very reasonable.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi7":"Driving in and around Abu Dhabi\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi8":"Key Routes\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi9":"Many motorways run through Abu Dhabi, making it quick and easy to get around within the emirate. The E10 and E12 connect the islands to the mainland, while the E22 runs out to the oasis city of Al Ain.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi10":"These motorways connect to local city streets to help you get to just the right part of Abu Dhabi and make it fairly easy to navigate.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi11":"Major Highways\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi12":"If you want to get out to explore more of the UAE when you rent a car in Abu Dhabi, the E11 is the main route you will need. It connects all of the emirates along the Persian Gulf, giving you easy access to Dubai, Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah. The route lets you see some of the dazzling sights of the UAE as you drive through, as well as tantalising glimpses of the ocean.\\n\\n","driving-in.abu-dhabi13":"Speed limits can be changeable on the motorway so you should check for local signs to advise you of the caps. They are usually somewhere between 140km/h and 100km/h (between 85 and 60mph) depending on the particular stretch of road and whether or not it is running through a built-up area.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah1":"Car rental in Sharjah, the third largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is easy thanks to Erbil car rental branches conveniently located at the airport and within the city itself.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah2":"It’s advisable to rent a car in Sharjah if you want to get around. The dazzling city does have an intercity bus service and many taxis, but hiring a car gives you the flexibility to see the emirate at your own pace, as well as enabling you to travel into neighbouring Dubai. Hiring a car means you can take a trip to the sandy white beaches at the Sharjah Cornich before heading off to see some of Sharjah’s cultural attractions. It also means you’ll be able to carry all of your shopping from the Souq Al Arsah – the oldest marketplace in the UAE.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah3":"Driving and Parking in Sharjah\\n","driving-in.sharjah4":"You will need a full driving licence and must be over 21 to rent a car in Sharjah. If you are from outside the United Arab Emirates you will also need an International Driving Permit (IDP). For more information about driving regulations in Sharjah, take a look at our page about renting a car in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah5":"Although there is some free and private parking around Sharjah, most parking is managed by Sharjah Municipality and is paid for via SMS. Full details of how this works can be found on Sharjah Municipality’s website, but it involves you sending a text message including your licence plate details and receiving a text message back with your parking permit. 10 minute before this is due to expire, you will receive a reminder message to which you can reply to extend the permit. The parking charges will be paid via your phone bill.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah6":"Driving in Sharjah follows the rules of the majority of the United Arab Emirates. You drive on the right hand side of the road and you should be aware that flashing your lights can mean that another vehicle is coming through, as opposed to giving way. You should stay focused on the road as driving is fast paced. So if you hire a car in the UAE make sure you always follow the rules of the road.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah7":"Driving in and around Sharjah\\n","driving-in.sharjah8":"Key Routes\\n","driving-in.sharjah9":"The biggest key route through Sharjah is the E11 motorway, which links Sharjah with Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Umm al Quwayn, Ras Al Khaimah and other important towns and cities within the UAE. It runs across the city and links with other key highways.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah10":"Another key route in Sharjah is Corniche Street, which runs right along the waterfront. A beautiful drive in itself thanks to stunning views, Corniche Street also accesses some of the major hotels and resorts in Sharjah.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah11":"Major Highways\\n","driving-in.sharjah12":"There are several major highways that run from Sharjah, connecting it to other key locations so you can plan your itinerary when you rent a car in Sharjah.\\n\\n","driving-in.sharjah13":"Motorways such as the E11, E88, E102, E311, E611 and S112 connect Sharjah with other parts of the UAE, making it easy to navigate and explore. You should be very aware of speed limits on these roads as Sharjah have installed radars to monitor speeds and you can be issued with a hefty fine depending on how much you exceed the local limit by. To avoid problems, make sure you’re aware of the local speed limit at all times. Motorways designated with an ‘E’ refer to roads that connect different emirates, roads marked with an ’S’ run within the emirate.\\n\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah1":"Car rental in Ras al-Khaimah is made incredibly easy thanks to Erbil’s conveniently located branch at Al Hamra Mall. Renting a car gives you the freedom and opportunity to explore this fascinating emirate and its rich history while enjoying a relaxing holiday. A car also gives you the benefit of air conditioning and shade — essential when travelling in the hot sun.\\n\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah2":"Ras Al-Khaimah is home to a diverse group of towns and cities each with their own cultural identity — and all within an easy drive of each other. You could, for instance, take one of the beach hotels in Ras Al-Khaimah City as your base and visit the town of Rams which was once known for pearl diving and is now famous for its bird watching. Or take a trip out to Sham to see the old wadi settlements and engravings in the rocks as well as a picturesque harbour.\\n\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah3":"Driving and Parking in Ras al-Khaimah\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah4":"You will need a full driving licence and must be over 21 to rent a car in Ras al-Khaimah.

For more information about driving regulations in Ras al Khaimah, take a look at our page about renting a car in the UAE.\\n\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah5":"Driving in Ras al-Khaimah can be a mixed experience. On the one hand, the roads are in excellent condition and navigation is pretty easy — particularly in the city itself. However, driving in Ras al Khaimah, as in the rest of the UAE, can be fairly chaotic since locals rarely pay heed to the rules of the road. Ensure your safety by observing speed limits, wearing your seatbelt (enforceable by law) and ensuring you follow the instructions on road signs.\\n\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah6":"When you rent a car in Ras al-Khaimah you will find that parking is much like the rest of the UAE with metered parking bays, pay-to-park car parks as well as free parking at your hotel. There are steep penalties if you park illegally or do not pay the correct charge so double check this before leaving your car.\\n\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah7":"Driving in and around Ras Al Khaimah\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah8":"Key Routes\\n","driving-in.ras-al-khaimah9":"The key route through Ras al-Khaimah is the Al Rams Road (E18) which runs through the middle of the emirate and connects the towns and cities to the International Airport.
